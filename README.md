# Hardy Paradox of Cyclic Entanglement

This repository contains simulations of Hardy-type nonlocality of the cyclic entanglement configuration of a four-particle system using quantum computers.

The notebooks are used in the paper titled "Hardyâ€™s nonlocality for entangled pairs in a four-particle system". 
## Simulation
- Quantum circuits are simulated through IBM's QASM simulator.
- Hardy-type nonlocality is observed through three sets of conditions Hardy-type nonlocality simulation .ipynb
