# Hardy-type nonlocality of Cyclic Entanglement

This repository contains simulations of Hardy-type nonlocality of the cyclic entanglement configuration of a four-particle system using quantum computers.

The notebooks are used in the paper titled "Hardyâ€™s nonlocality for entangled pairs in a four-particle system". 
## Simulation
- Executed when Qiskit was in version 0.23.
- Quantum circuits are simulated through IBM's QASM simulator.
- Hardy-type nonlocality is observed through three sets of conditions ([Notebooks/Simulating Hardy-type nonlocality.ipynb](https://github.com/doan-duc1902/Hardy-nonlocality-of-cylic-entanglement/blob/main/Notebooks/Simulating%20Hardy-type%20nonlocality.ipynb))
## Theta sweep test
- Executed when Qiskit was in version 0.23.
- The experiment is also executed through IBM's QASM simulator.
- The results are shown in ([Notebooks/Theta sweep test_Hardy nonlocality.ipynb](https://github.com/doan-duc1902/Hardy-nonlocality-of-cylic-entanglement/blob/main/Notebooks/Theta%20sweep%20test_Hardy%20nonlocality.ipynb))
## Practical examination on IBM Bribsbane
- Executed when Qiskit is in version 2.0.0.
- Due to resource constraints and limited time available for backend usage, each circuit in this experiment is only executed with 2048 shots, which is considerably smaller than that in simulation.
- The Brisbane results are shown in ([Notebooks/Hardy-type nonlocality on IBM_Brisbane.ipynb](https://github.com/doan-duc1902/Hardy-nonlocality-of-cylic-entanglement/blob/main/Notebooks/Hardy-type%20nonlocality%20on%20IBM_Brisbane.ipynb))
- The comparision betwween Brisbane results and their simulation counterpart are shown in ([Notebooks/Comparision between Brisbane and simulation.ipynb](https://github.com/doan-duc1902/Hardy-nonlocality-of-cylic-entanglement/blob/main/Notebooks/Comparision%20between%20Brisbane%20and%20simulation.ipynb))
